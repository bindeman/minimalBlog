Four, Oh, hey there! My name is Louis XVI and I am now officially in heaven. I would like to thank you all for finally making this happen. Anyway, as much as I want to sip my Pina Colada and just chill in heaven, the events that are happening in France are too distressing and must be addressed before havoc is further unleashed. Many of you may not support the monarchy, but our current situation is pure anarchy and must be stopped before our single united France is forever lost. Structure that has been present during the monarchy has been eradicated. Uncertainty and instability have plagued our country. Now that you have killed me, you must deal with numerous rebellions like the Vendée rebellion in which under Robespierre's rule thousands of peasants were killed that you promised to protect and feed. Robespierre killed off the Catholic church’s influence, and stole its land for his own selfish motivations. People of Lyon and Marseilles, part of rebellious group that knows the real truth, declared that they want their king and priests back. Rosepierre, how is it that all you can do is slaughter them? The Reign of Terror exemplifies your belief in liberty and constitutionality. 16,000 men, women, and children dead just so you can stay in power, and neglect the needs of real people. Because you killed me, most western powers are against you, your interests, and wish for your immediate demise. You now have to fight a war, further extracting resources and money that belong to the people you promised to care for. If you never killed me, France would have avoided this violent path, would be supported by its neighbors, and unified by Catholicism. Once again, thank you for sending me to heaven!\n","date":"November 17, 2017","id":3,"url":"this-is-another-post-I-would-like-to-make"},{"title":"Here's a new post","body":"We're trying to see what would happen","date":"Apr 20, 2020","id":4},{"title":"There is something about what we are doing today","body":"Let's take a look","date":"Apr 20, 2020","id":5},{},{"title":"We're not sure if the current system is up","body":"Here is a way to test things out so that we know for sure","id":1587455715621,"date":"Apr 21, 2020","url":"we-re-not-sure-if-the-current-system-is-up"}]}
